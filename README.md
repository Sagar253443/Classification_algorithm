# Flower Classification

## Project Description

This repository demonstrates the application of various classification algorithms to the IRIS flower dataset. The IRIS dataset contains measurements of iris flowers from three different species (Setosa, Versicolor, and Virginica), with features such as sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width.

The project focuses on implementing and evaluating multiple classification techniques to classify iris flowers based on these features. The goal is to compare the performance of different algorithms in accurately classifying the species of iris flowers.

Key objectives of the project include:

- **Algorithm Implementation:** Applying various classification algorithms such as Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machines, Decision Trees, and Neural Networks to the IRIS dataset.
- **Performance Evaluation:** Measuring and comparing the accuracy and effectiveness of each classification algorithm.
- **Result Analysis:** Analyzing which algorithms perform best for classifying iris flower species and understanding their strengths and limitations.
